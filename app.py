# To use functions from a library you installed via pip, you have to import them first.
# Importing functions using the "from x import a, b, c" style allows you to use
# the function directly. In other words, you can write a(), b() instead of x.a(), x.b() each time
# you want to call the imported functions.

# on your laptop.
